# UCT 3rd Year Lab: ATLAS Open Data 2025

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for the UCT 3rd Year Lab, focusing on analyzing ATLAS Open Data to rediscover the Higgs boson and measure the Z boson mass. These exercises are designed to introduce students to data analysis techniques in particle physics.

## Repository Structure

- **Part1_MeasureTheZBosonMass.ipynb**  
  This notebook guides students through the process of measuring the Z boson mass using ATLAS Open Data. It includes steps for importing data, applying event selections, reconstructing the Z boson, and fitting statistical models to the data.

- **Part2_RediscoverTheHiggsBoson.ipynb**  
  This notebook focuses on rediscovering the Higgs boson by analyzing diphoton events. It covers data preparation, event selection, histogram creation, and statistical modeling to identify the Higgs boson signal.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later (I used Python 3.10)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Files

The notebooks require input data files that can be downloaded from the following link:
[ATLAS Open Data Files](https://uctcloud-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/01466689_wf_uct_ac_za/En-_dYktEINOu3XP2z3VDK8B3NCT_Wj7shIBVCcV72SkAg?e=cu1Ldy)

Place all downloaded files in the same directory as the notebooks.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd UCT3rdYearLabATLASOpenData2024
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook interface:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open and run the notebooks:
   - Start with `Part1_MeasureTheZBosonMass.ipynb` to measure the Z boson mass.
   - Proceed to `Part2_RediscoverTheHiggsBoson.ipynb` to rediscover the Higgs boson.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of particle physics data analysis.
- Learn how to apply event selection criteria to isolate specific physics processes.
- Gain experience in reconstructing particle properties from detector data.
- Fit statistical models to data and interpret the results.
